# Requirements completed

- The posts page displays the title of all posts, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order alphabetically.
- The database has a posts table connected to a comments table with a foreign key.
- Comments can be deleted from the database by clicking on the menu next to the comment.
- The dynamic post page contains a form which saves comments for that post.
- Users can comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments are associated with posts, which have a dynamic route (i.e. /posts/:postid) (See above)
- When the user adds a comment, the dynamic post path is revalidated, so the user can see their comment underneath the post.

# Stretch goals completed

- The blog admin can create, update and delete posts from the database. This is done via the 'Manage' page.
- When the admin adds a post they are then redirected to the posts list page which is revalidated.
- Posts have categories, and can be selected by category on the 'Categories' page
- Users can update comments on the post page by clicking on the menu next to the comment.

# Extra little things

- The HomePage displays a preview of the most recent post.
- Line breaks in post content are respected when the content is rendered because I'm not a fan of massive blocks of text.
- I have both client and server components, which I thought was a requirement but wasn't? I needed it that way anyway.
